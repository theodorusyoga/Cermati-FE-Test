## How To Run Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `yarn start`

Run the app in `production` mode after `yarn build` is successfully run. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the production mode in the browser. You will not see debugging mode in the browser, unlike `yarn dev`.

In this case, this app is deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for fast deployment.
